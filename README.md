# numero

`numero` is a library which parses/extracts a decimal number, either integer or floating-point, either in scientific notation or not, from the given input string. It uses the thousands and decimal separator symbols given in the conversion options. 

It also provides methods for the inverse operation, i.e. converting a value to a (English) human-readable text, e.g. "one thousand and twenty four" for `1024`.
